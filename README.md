3R (React, Redux, Ramda) Calculator
=======================

Calculator web app built with React, Redux, Ramda and point free functional programming.

### TODO
* 100% test coverage
* Sidebar with keyboard buttons (or what else?)
* ~~Twitter button~~
* Add a light theme
* Add `<ThemeSelector>` buttons
* Scroll to bottom *after* inserting a calculation.
* Refactor the application of styles. Currently styles are in multiple places. Consider moving to a single place, or modularize everywhere. Remove Radium if not used.
* Finalize styles and layout.
* Test on smaller screens.
