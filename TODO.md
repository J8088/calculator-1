TODO
=======================

* 100% test coverage
* Sidebar with calculator buttons
* ~~Twitter button~~
* Add a light theme
* Add `<ThemeSelector>` buttons
* Scroll to bottom *after* inserting a calculation.
* Refactor the application of styles. Currently styles are in multiple places. Consider moving to a single place, or modularize everywhere. Remove Radium if not used.
* Finalize styles and layout.
* Test on smaller screens.
* Calculate and show the result while typing.
* Numbers next to each calculation (within the margin).
* Refactor configuration settings (such as author, repo URL) into an easy to edit file. Store the settings into Redux store for easy access within the components.
* Add a help modal.
* Arrow up/down: scroll through previous inputs.
